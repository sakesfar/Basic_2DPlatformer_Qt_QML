# Basic_2DPlatformer_Qt_QML
This simple 2D game is under development

The game is a refined version of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Tu3m1SwOI
with all the major logic in C++ and QML for GUI.

**The following aspects, the ones I consider major, I am currently working on :**
1. Adding an ability to shoot from distance for the main character
2. Adding one or two more enemies
3. Implementing an archaic AI for enemies (?)
4. Better UI
5. Adding audio
   
Increasing the game map is a minor challenge

**CONTROL KEYS:**
*up/left/right* for movement and *1* for attack
