# Basic_2DPlatformer_Qt_QML
This simple 2D game is under development.
**A major caveat to go through is adding y-scrolling to accommodate a bigger gamemap. [ALREADY SOLVED]**

The game video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Tu3m1SwOI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HBdARQMZs&ab_channel=Sakesfar)]
with all the major logic in C++ and QML for GUI.

**The following aspects, the ones I consider major, I am currently working on :**
1. Adding an ability to shoot/interact from a distance for the main character
2. Adding one or two more enemies(Done)
3. Improving AI for enemies (Under development)
4. Better UI(under development)
6. Debugging
   A. Improved code. Adherence to DRY.
   B. Better naming conventions (:DD very subjective)
   C. Short code for functions
   D. Got rid off magic numbers
   E. Still a huge room to improve.
8. Developing a demo level 1 with a better visual style.
   

**CONTROL KEYS:**
