# Basic_2DPlatformer_Qt_QML
This simple 2D game is under development.
**A major caveat to go through is adding y-scrolling to accommodate a bigger gamemap.**

The game video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Tu3m1SwOI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6HBdARQMZs&ab_channel=Sakesfar)]
with all the major logic in C++ and QML for GUI.

**The following aspects, the ones I consider major, I am currently working on :**
1. Adding an ability to shoot from distance for the main character
2. Adding one or two more enemies
3. Improving AI for enemies (?)
4. Better UI
5. Adding audio
6. Debugging
7. Optimizing the code (so far updated cpp files reflecting better code practices)
   
Increasing the game map is a minor challenge

**CONTROL KEYS:**
*/left/right* for movement and *1* for attack
*space - jump
